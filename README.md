# IASC 2P02 | Dylan Pietrangelo

## Bio
I am a second-year student in the IASC program at Brock University. IASC focuses on many aspects of technology and digital humanities. My research this term has been on digital tools and researching scholarly questions in the humanities department. All of my research this term has gone towards my portfolio, where I can present and show all my completed work. This term we were using GitHub as one of the many tools throughout the term. We were able to post everything we worked on or researched over the term which was shared or saved onto GitHub. Our first project was the Collaborative Project, where we worked in teams researching a new tool we could interact with. Throughout the term we were given many articles to read; and our second project was the blog post, where we had to respond to one of the course readings and demonstrate key arguments throughout them and support or disagree with the authors. Our third project was the research presentation, where we had a solo presentation with a Pecha Kucha 15x20 format. This was the first time I have heard about a slide show like this and I was very impressed by it. Rather than someone presenting and pausing In between slides to forward to the next slide this tool was able to advance automatically so the presenter can keep talking. Throughout this term we were able to research many different tools. These tools were not only for this course but they were learning experiences that we could take with us throughout our studies in Digital Humanities in university or the real world.

## Featured Presentation: Revision of the Research Presentation

This project focuses on old media archaeology and seeing it new. We had to research technology that was used in the past or present, then present it through a Pecha Kucha format. I chose to work with Black Mirror for this presentation. The reason I chose this is because there were several uses of an interactive contact lens found within the series that could be used in our future. I made a direct reference to how people were interrogated in the past and how they will be interrogated in the future. The reason this is important because we can justify when a person is lying or telling the truth. With this lens we will be able to tell not only when the person is lying but when they are telling the truth. Through several different windows we can tell when the interrogated person has their heart rate increasing during several questions, if they are accumulating more sweat and many more. These are just a few that were shown in Black Mirror. I also presented on how the military could use this type of technology. Preparation is key when it comes to any mission the military is assigned with, and without all possible outcomes assessed the soldiers could be injured or even killed. Through this interactive lens the soldiers are able to train harder, sleep better, and access a heads-up display while in the real world. But this type of technology isn’t only used for the military, it could be used for lawyers, doctors or even the ordinary person at home. Please type “s” on the finals 5 slides added to the Pecha Kucha to see the notes added. 

Here is my 250-word revision on how Black Mirrors interactive contact lens is used and how it can improve the world we live in today. Within the television series Black Mirror, they are given this lens that can interact with the person wearing them in many ways. Here you can see the changes I have made to my Research Presentation [here](https://github.com/dp12ll/IASC---2P02/commit/83a968372bfb6a87957f3159f3f1ea0add2d5437)) The reason I am only placing one commit is because I could not find a way to place different commits from a piece of code. From the instructor feedback I was told to use media archeology a little more found in my presentation. So, I used that more within my revisions. I placed more information about interrogations and polygraphs. I also looked into Black Mirror a little more with another example of them using the interactive lens through a different perspective through the person being accused and found a couple images there. I also added some health indications when someone is using the lens. When messing with the mind and placing someone in a time lock simulation the mind could change the way the person is portraying it and could create something the body isn’t used to. My understanding of the digital humanities was evolved from this project because I have found new ways to understand it. With media archeology that I have researched has become more understandable and memorable than before. 

## Collaborative Project

The main focus towards this project is to research and tryout the program and present it to others hoping this tool can be useful in the future.  The theory behind working in teams is to have more than one opinion on the same project because everyone interprets a different meaning. Throughout this project we were each given a task to research within the tool to find out what it was used for. For a single person it would be hard for someone to gather all the information and present it correctly, I could have missed something or interpreted the tool incorrectly. Within a team we were able to collect the information together and put the information gathered into a presentation. 

Collaboration is used in many ways. Collaborations definition describes it as working with someone to create something. During this presentation we were working with a group to research a tool online and dissect it into parts. This is where the team came together to research everything we could find on the tool and present it. With one person something can easily be overlooked, but with different people reading over the same thing 5 different times (5 team members) it is easier for the group to talk to each other and describe what the program is all about. Every one interprets information differently. Sometimes they could have read it the wrong way or they just need someone to explain it to them to receive an easier way of saying it. Regardless working in a team develops ways in which everyone can work together to find the solution. When working in a group a couple things need to happen, the introduction stage, turns into the information stage, and that turns into the productive stage. The introduction and information stages are when to find out who people are and where they can put their best efforts in towards the project. At first its important to have a little fun and get to know each other before you get down to business. But then it comes down to the productive stage where there is no more joking around and its time to work together on the project.
