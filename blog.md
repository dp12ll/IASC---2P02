Everyone has their own theory and way to represent information they have gathered. Stephen Ramsay's Algorithmic criticism was incredibly difficult to follow. There are many algorithms that I could not understand because I do not know anything about literary criticism. He gives tones of information about how he follows it and interprets it using his own material. For someone who already knows how literary criticism works they would be able to follow his article very easily. Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels gave a very interesting interpretation when talking about how if you read poems differently they can give someone a different perspective through the poem. They gave a few examples of how the same poem just read differently can interpret different meanings to whomever is reading it and how they read it. Stephen Ramsay says something similar “Algorithmic criticism undoubtedly requires a revolution of sorts, but that revolution is not one of new procedures and methods in contradistinction to the old ones.” (Ramsay, 17) The meaning of this quote has a different interpretation on the reader if they are using the algorithmic revolution or different methods within. Even though these are two different techniques they both represent the same thing. All of these people use a different technique/algorithm to extract data and material from the reading and helps the reader interpret the information differently. Everyone has their own way to gather information from whatever they are reading, some use imagery to try to picture what is happening or to demonstrate the algorithm. David M.Berry and Anders Fagerjord’s Digital Humanities : Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Scholarship and Interface Criticism says something similar, “Several scholars have used digital media to think through the relations between interface and text, and to demonstrate the applicability and power of their theories.”
