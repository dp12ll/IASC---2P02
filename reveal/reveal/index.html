					When a person is interrogated today they are set in a dark room with a light on them and asked questions. This is a tactic used by lawyers and police so the person is scared and helpless. This helps get the information the interrogator needs. But what is so helpless and scary about this interrogation? This is the reason interrogations fail. People know how to beat the lie detector test if they are trained and they also don’t need to talk if they don’t want too. Sure, the reason people don’t talk is because they have something to hide, but, they can only keep someone here for so long.

					Here a person is in an interrogation chamber where they have a screen full of the interrogation tactics the person is going to use against them. This is a futuristic example because we do not have the capabilities to do these things on the spot but with the technology used in Black Mirror we would be able to. The person is handcuffed to the chair and looks very depressed because they were able to show the person exactly what they are looking into at the time and show the person that they are getting what they want. This is a strong interrogation tactic used.

					Using the interactive contact lens found in Black Mirror we would be able to use it on the person. Download something that the person could see and something maybe not so friendly. Like a white room with nothing. Leave the person there for several hours or days and see if the person would eventually talk. This is a very horrific sight for the person and could possibly speed up the process. The only problem with this is this would be last resort, and this type of technology could be very unhealthy for the user.

					An example from Black Mirror is used here. With the lens implanted the person is given a room with nothing in it but a keyboard to interact with if they comply. If they do not they will be given time to think about it which is simulated between a week to several months. The person does not die but it is simulated that the person will eventually answer any question given because they are so bored and want to eventually talk to someone or even get out of the state that they are in.

				<aside class="notes">
					In conclusion, a person in the past would have to put on a polygraph to detect if the person is lying. This test could be beaten and there were many examples of it. The problem with this type of technology is it isn’t perfect. The interactive contact lens found in Black Mirror could be used for many other things not only for this. But this is just one of the many reasons the future has many things in store for us. If this test can be beaten why wouldn’t your password to your bank account be hacked into? Or your password for your credit card?
